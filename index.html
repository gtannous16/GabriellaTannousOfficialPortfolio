                    On June 16, 2013, Gabriella married her husband and supported him as he answered his 
                    calling to the Orthodox Christian Priesthood. Since then, they have lived in New York 
                    and Fort Lauderdale, before finally settling down in Atlanta, Georgia where they currently 
                    live with their adorable dog Kallie!

                    believes that the youth is the future!

                    Gabriella loves to be on her computer spending hours geeking out and writing code. She also 
                    loves reading, watching movies, building LEGO’s and has a serious obsession with Harry Potter!
